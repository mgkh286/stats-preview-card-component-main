## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Accessibility
- background properties
- position layout

### What I learned

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
<div class="img-section"></div>
```

```css
.img-section {
  height: 32vh;
  width: 100%;
  background: linear-gradient(
      hsla(277, 100%, 25%, 0.514) 100%,
      rgba(255, 255, 255, 0)
    ),
    url(images/image-header-mobile.jpg);
  background-size: cover;
}
```

### Continued development

i will focus on using flexbox layout in the future projects. These concepts am comfortable with and i found tit very useful .

i will focus on using relative units vh or vw it helps me to write short and clean code .

i will focus on specificity using class or id selectors .

i will focus on  using color variables  .

i will focus on  using background properties .

i will focus on  mobile first design .
